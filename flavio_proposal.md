## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

Social networks websites have become an important communication tool and source of information. The hours spent in average connected per day in the past years is up to 6 hours [[1]](https://www.emarketer.com/Report/US-Time-Spent-with-Media-eMarketers-Updated-Estimates-2017/2002142) for adults and 9 for teenagers, while 30% of this time is on social networks [[2]](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media-use-by-tweens-and-teens). During a normal navigation on such platforms, users are exposed to several posts such as friends' statuses, images, news and more. With such amount of information and variety of content, the time for the user to decide to interact with the content is very small. Gitte at al. [3] suggest that we take around 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression and this has proved to be very powerful in a wide range of contexts.

Besides being a place for connecting with friends and sharing moments of the user's life, a survey has shown that social networks are also used as a source of news and information by 67% of the users [[4]](http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/). 80% of the articles are read inside the platform and 20% are read on an external site [5]. Part of these posts are articles that can be read on an external website. Typically such posts show the title of the article and sometimes a small part of its content and an image.

Considering the offer of content and competition with so many interesting posts, showing a proper title for the post affects the probability that a user will check the content. This measure has a strong impact on how many readers an article will have and how much of the content will be read. Furthermore, showing the user a content they prefer (to interact) increases the user satisfaction. It is thus important to accurately estimate the interaction rate of articles based on its title.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

When an author writes a text, it is expected that their words will influence and bring value to the readers. While writing, the title is one of the important details that needs to be taken in consideration, because this will normally be the first contact place of their work. Thus, to create a good first impression, to have more people read the article and interact with it, choosing a good title is very important.

Some of the most used platforms to spread ideas nowadays are Twitter [[6]](https://www.twitter.com) and Medium [[7]](https://www.medium.com). On the first one, articles are normally posted including external URLs and the title, where users can access and demonstrate satisfaction with "Likes" or "Retweeting" (sharing) of the original post. The second one shows the full text with tags to classify the article and "Applause" (similar to Twitter's "Likes") to show how much the users appreciate the content. A correlation between these two networks can bring us more valuable information.

The problem to be solved: Predict the range of likes and shares count an article receives based on its title; and analyse how the title length and the tags have performed.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

The data used to predict how titles will perform was gathered from the accounts of the non-profit organization FreeCodeCamp on Medium [[8]](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/) and Twitter [[9]](https://twitter.com/freecodecamp). With both social platforms, it was possible to get public information about how the users interacted with the content, such as "Likes" and "Retweets" from Twitter, and "Applause" from Medium.

The reason to correlate the number of "Likes" and "Retweets" from Twitter with a Medium article, was to try to isolate the effect of number of reached readers and number of Medium "Applauses". Because the more the article is shared in different platforms, the more readers it will reach and the more Medium "Applauses" it will receive. Using only the Twitter statistic, it is expected that the articles reached initially almost the same number of readers (that are the followers of the FreeCodeCamp account on Twitter), and the performance and interactions with it are limited to the characteristics of the tweet, for example, the title of the article, that is exactly what we want to measure.

It was decided to choose FreeCodeCamp account, because the idea is to limit the scope of the subject of the articles and predict better the response on a specif field. The same title can perform well on one category (e.g. Technology), but not necessarly on a different one (e.g. Culinary). Also this account posts as the Tweet content the title of the original article and the URL on Medium.

After getting the articles from FreeCodeCamp written on Medium and shared on Twitter, there is a dataset of 719 datapoints. Here are some examples of such correlation:

| Title | Retweet Count | Favorite Count | Medium Hearts | Medium Categories  | Created at | URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ES9: JavaScript's state of the art in 2018 | 15 | 48 | 618 | Technology, Programming, Tech, Startup, JavaScript | 2018-07-23 17:02:04 | https://medium.freecodecamp.org/es9-javascripts-state-of-art-in-2018-9a350643f29c |

Description of the dataset fields:

| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Title | The content of the tweet, FreeCodeCamp normally uses the title of the article from Medium and sometimes the username of the author from Twitter |
| Retweet Count | How many times that tweet was "Retweeted" on Twitter |
| Favorite Count | How many times that tweet was marked as favorite on Twitter |
| Medium Hearts | How many times that article was marked as favorite on Medium |
| Medium Categories | Which tags were used to tag the article on Medium |
| Created at | When the tweet was posted |
| URL | The website of the article on Medium |


### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

Classification is a common task of machine learning (ML), which involves predicting a target variable taking in consideration the previous data [11]. To reach such classification, it is necessary to create a model with the previous training data, and then use it to predict the value of the test data [12]. This process is called Supervised Learning, since the data processing phase is guided toward the class variable while building the model [13].

Predicting number of shares and likes of an article can be treated as a classification problem, because the output will be discrete values (range of shares and likes). As input, the title of the articles with each word as a token t1, t2, t3, ... tn.

For this task we will evaluate the following algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression. In the end, it will be compared the performance of each one of them and one will be chosen. To estimate accuracy, it will be used a 5-fold cross validation, that splits the dataset in 5 parts, 4 of trainning and 1 of testing. The implementation of this project will be made usying Python, Numpy [[14]](http://www.numpy.org/) and Scikit [[15]](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

This project will run the same testing and training data for multiple algorithms, the comparison between them can be used to evaluate the overall performance.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

At least one evaluation metric is necessary to quantify the performance of the benchmarks and solution model. For this project, it will be used the accuracy, which is the number of correct predictions made as a ratio of all predictions made.

Accuracy = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions made

This metric only works well if there are similar number of samples belonging to each class. For this reason, we will divide the range of shares and likes count in a way that respects this distribution. 

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

The steps to solve the proposed problem will take as reference the one proposed by S. Raschka [[16]](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_intro_supervised_learning.html). They are:

* **Data gathering:** This step is responsible to get the datasets that will be used on to analyse, train and test the models. These datas were already gathered from Twitter and Medium and aggregated like showed in the section "Datasets and Inputs".
* **Data pre-processing:** The dataset will be cleaned, formatted or added the missing values.
* **Exploring Data**
    * **Prepare environment to run the simulations:** The environment used to make this simulation will be a Jupyter Notebook. For each of the steps, we will describe what is expected and show the Python code used for the implementation.
    * **Implementation Data Exploration:** 
    * Preprocess Feature Columns
    * Training and Testing Data Split
* Training and Evaluating Models
  * Model Performance Metrics
* Choosing the Best Model
