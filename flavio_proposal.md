## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

Social networks websites have become an important communication tool and source of information. The hours spent in average connected per day in the past years is up to 6 hours [1] for adults and 9 for teenagers, while 30% of this time is on social networks [2]. During a normal navigation on such platforms, users are exposed to several posts such as friends' statuses, images, news and more. With such amount of information and variety of content, the time for the user to decide to interact with the content is very small. Gitte at al. [3] suggest that we take around 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression and this has proved to be very powerful in a wide range of contexts.

Besides being a place for connecting with friends and sharing moments of the user's life, a survey has shown that social networks are also used as a source of news and information by 67% of the users [4]. 80% of the articles are read inside the platform and 20% are read on an external site [5]. Part of these posts are articles that can be read on an external website. Typically such posts show the title of the article and sometimes a small part of its content and an image.

Considering the offer of content and competition with so many interesting posts, showing a proper title for the post affects the probability that a user will check the content. This measure has a strong impact on how many readers an article will have and how much of the content will be read. Furthermore, showing the user a content they prefer (to interact) increases the user satisfaction. It is thus important to accurately estimate the interaction rate of articles based on its title.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

When the author writes a text, it is expected that his words will reach a reasonable number of readers, and will influence and bring value to the readers. During the creation of the content, the title is one of the important details that needs to be taken in consideration, because it will normally the first contact the reader will probably have with the article. Thus, to create a good first impression, try to have more people reading the article and interacting with it, choosing a good title is very important.

Some of the most used platforms to spread ideas nowadays are Twitter and Medium. On the first one, normally is posted external urls with its tile, where the users can access and demonstrate its satisfaction with "Likes" or "Retweeting" (shares) the original post. The second one, there is the full content with tags to classify the article and "Applause" (similar to Twitter "Likes") to show the user appretiated the content. 

The problem to be solved: Predict the number of likes and shares an article receives based on title's words. Also analyse how the title length and the categories chosen to tag the text perform.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
